ABS Packages
------------

ABS packages (APK) are JAR files that contain ABS files
and other ABS packages. To be recognized as an ABSPK
file, a JAR file must have a manifest entry 

ABS-Package-Version: 1.0

APK files can be used as input for all ABS tools that
use the standard ABS frontend. 
When used as input all ABS files and all ABS packages 
(recursively) that are contained in the package are 
read by the frontend.

APK files can either be build by using the
standard jar tool, or by using the abspk tool.
