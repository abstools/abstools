Inside this repository we develop the core tools of the ABS modelling
language.  The current language manual is at http://docs.abs-models.org.

To run the ABS collaboratory (a browser-based IDE for ABS) locally using
Docker, execute the following command:

    docker run -p 8080:80 --rm abslang/collaboratory:latest

Then connect your browser to http://localhost:8080/.  It is not necessary to
clone the repository or compile the toolchain to run the ABS collaboratory in this way.

To run the absc compiler locally using docker, create a script such as
https://github.com/abstools/abstools/blob/master/frontend/src/main/resources/bash/absc-docker
and put it in your path.

Folders
-------

* `frontend` - the ABS compiler and runtime support.  See
  frontend/README.md for installation instructions.  (short version:
  install jdk8 and erlang version 21, then run `make frontend` or
  `./gradlew assemble` in this directory, or `.\gradlew.bat assemble`
  on windows.)


* `abs-docs` - the ABS language manual, available online at
  http://docs.abs-models.org.  To generate the manual locally, install maven,
  then run `make manual`.

  * `abs-docs/ReferenceManual` - an older LaTeX ABS reference manual,
    now mostly of historical interest

  * `abs-docs/Ott` - a formal grammar for a large subset of ABS,
    written in [Ott](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/)


* `emacs` - Editor support for ABS -- moved to
  https://github.com/abstools/abs-mode but left here for existing users.

* `org.abs-models.releng` - Files used by Jenkins and Buckminster for
  continuous integration at https://envisage.ifi.uio.no:8080/jenkins/.

* `abs-packages` - demonstration and description of how to use ABS
  packages (with Maven dependencies management)

* `abs-unit` - demonstration, description and initial ideas about the
  ABSUnit (a unit testing framework for ABS) (with Maven dependencies
  management)

* various leftovers from previous projects, to be evaluated and
  reactivated or pruned

    * `maven-support` - Maven plugin for generating Java/Maude from ABS,
      testing and packaging ABS codes

Using Vagrant
-------------

To develop the ABS tools without installing additional software, you
can use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).  Vagrant will start a
Linux virtual machine and install the needed dependencies.

First, install Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and
VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org

To create the ABS virtual machine, run the command `vagrant up` in this
directory.  Run `vagrant ssh` to login to that machine (login vagrant/vagrant), or open
http://localhost:8888/ to connect to a local version of the collaboratory.
Currently supported browsers include Firefox, Chrome, recent IE (no Safari).

Within the VM, this directory is accessible as `/vagrant`.

Note for Windows Users
----------------------

Please clone the archive without line ending conversion (unfortunately
activated by default on Windows).  Use `-c core.autocrlf=false` as argument
for the initial `git clone` command, i.e.,

    git clone https://github.com/abstools/abstools -c core.autocrlf=false

Otherwise, running the tools inside Vagrant or Docker will fail with obscure
error messages.

Working with the repository
---------------------------

Consider rebasing instead of merging your changes:

    git pull --rebase

This avoids spurious "merge branch to master" commits.

`git pull --rebase` will, in case both you and the remote repository
have new commits, replay your local commits on top of upstream changes
instead of adding a new local commit that merges the `master` and
`origin/master` branches.  Conflicts have to be resolved per patch
(via `git add` + `git rebase --continue`) instead of in one go, but we
get a cleaner history.
