== Expressions

This chapter specifies all ABS expressions.  ABS expressions can either be
side effect-free (i.e., part of the _functional sublanguage_) or have side effects.

.Syntax
|====
| _Exp_ ::= | _PureExp_ {vbar} _EffExp_
|====

The functional sublanguage of ABS is a purely-functional, side effect-free
language.  It comprises functions and operators on built-in datatypes,
user-defined algebraic datatypes, and user-defined functions defined on
datatypes.

Additionally, ABS contains a number of special expressions with well-defined
side effects, such as the `new` expression which creates a new object.
Expressions with side effects cannot be combined with other expressions, for
example as an argument to a function call.  This slight notational
inconvenience makes it easier to develop static analysis techniques and tools
for ABS.

[[sec:pure-expressions]]
=== Pure Expressions

Pure Expressions are side effect-free expressions.  The value of these
expressions only depends on their arguments, and they can be evaluated
multiple times without influencing the execution semantics.

==== Literal Expressions

Literals, as defined in <<sec:literals>>, are expressions.

==== Operator Expressions

ABS has a range of unary and binary operators working on pre-defined
datatypes.  All operators are pure (side effect-free).

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _OperatorExp_ ::= | _UnaryExp_ {vbar} _BinaryExp_
| _UnaryExp_ ::= | _UnaryOp_ _PureExp_
| _UnaryOp_ ::= | `!` {vbar} `-`
| _BinaryExp_ ::= | _PureExp_ _BinaryOp_ _PureExp_
| _BinaryOp_ ::= | `{vbar}{vbar}` {vbar} `&&` {vbar} `==` {vbar} `!=` {vbar} `<` {vbar} `\<=` {vbar} `>` {vbar} `>=` {vbar} `+` {vbar} `-` {vbar} `*` {vbar} `/` {vbar} `%`
|====


The following table describes the meaning as well as the associativity and the
precedence of the different operators. The list is sorted from low precedence
to high precedence.

|=======================


===== Semantics of Comparison Operators

ABS has generic equality and less-than comparison between two values of the
same type.

Equality and inequality comparison is standard: by value for functional
datatypes and by reference for objects and futures.  I.e., two strings
`"Hello"` compare as identical via `==`, as do two sets containing identical
values.  Two references to objects or futures compare as identical via `==` if
they point to the same object or future.  The inequality operator `!=`
evaluates to `True` for any two values that compare to `False` under `==` and
vice versa.

For the comparison operator `<`, an ordering is defined in the following way.

- Numbers compare as usual.

- Strings compare lexicographically.

- Algebraic datatypes compare first by constructor name, then by comparing
  constructor arguments left to right.

.Example
----
Cons(_, _) < Nil
Cons(1, _) < Cons(2, _)
----

- Objects and futures are compared by identity, in an implementation-specific
  but stable way.  This means that for any two variables `a` and `b` that
  point to different objects, the value of `a < b` does not change as long as
  `a` and `b` are not re-assigned.footnote:[This ordering is not guaranteed to
  be stable between two invocations of a program.  If ABS ever develops object
  serialization, care must be taken to uphold any datatype invariants across
  program invocations, e.g., when reading back an ordered list of objects.]


==== The Let Expression

The expression `let (T v) = p in b` evalutes `b`, with `v` bound to the value
of evaluating the expression `p`.  The newly-introduced binding of `v` can
shadow a binding of `v` outside of the `let` expression.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
|_LetExp_ ::= | `let` `(` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ `)` = _PureExp_ `in` _PureExp_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
let (Int x) = 2 + 2 in x * 2
----


==== The Data Constructor Expression


Data Constructor Expressions are expressions that create data values by
applying arguments to data type constructors.  Data constructor expressions
look similar to function calls, but data constructors always start with an
upper-case letter.

For data type constructors without parameters, the parentheses are optional.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _DataConstrExp_ ::= | _TypeIdentifier_ [ `(` [ _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ } ] `)` ]
|====

[source]
.Example
----
True
Cons(True, Nil)
Nil
----

Defining new data types and their constructors is described in
<<sec:algebraic-data-types>>.


==== The Function Call Expression

Function calls apply arguments to functions, producing a value.  Function call
expressions look similar to data constructor expressions, but function names
always start with a lower-case letter.  The parentheses are mandatory in
function calls.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _FnAppExp_ ::= | _Identifier_ `(` [ _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ } ] `)`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
tail(Cons(True, Nil))
head(list)
----


===== The N-ary Function Call Expression

Calls to n-ary Constructors (see <<sec:n_ary-constructors>>) are written with
brackets (`[]`) instead of parentheses (`()`).

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _FnAppListExp_ ::= | _Identifier_ `[` [ _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ } ] `]`
|====


==== The Partially-Defined-Function Call Expression

Calls to partially defined functions (see <<sec:partially-defined-functions>>) are similar to
function call expressions, but have an additional prepended set of arguments.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _ParFnApp_ ::= | _Identifier_ +
  `(` [ _ParFnAppParam_ { `,` _ParFnAppParam_ } ] `)` +
  `(` [ _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ } ] `)`

|  ParFnAppParam ::= | _Identifier_ +
                  {vbar} _AnonymousFunction_

|  AnonymousFunction ::= | `(` [ _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ { `,` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_  } ]  `)` `=>` _PureExp_ `;`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
map(toString)(list[1, 2])
filter((Int i) => i > 0)(list[0, 1, 2])
----


==== The Conditional Expression

The value of the conditional expression `if c then e1 else e2` is either the
value of `e1` or the value of `e2`, depending on the value of `c`, which must
be of type `Bool`.  Depending on the value of `c`, either `e1` or `e2` is
evaluated, but not both.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _IfExp_ ::= | `if` _PureExp_ `then` _PureExp_ `else` _PureExp_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
if 5 == 4 then True else False
----

[[case-expression]]
==== Case Expressions

ABS supports pattern matching via the Case Expression.  A case expression
consists of an input expression and a series of branches, each consisting of a
pattern and a right hand side expression.

The case expression evaluates its input expression and attempts to match the
resulting value against the branches until a matching pattern is found.  The
value of the case expression itself is the value of the expression on the
right-hand side of the first matching pattern.

If no pattern matches the expression, a `PatternMatchFailException` is thrown.

There are four different kinds of patterns available in ABS:

* Variables (with different semantics depending on whether the variable is bound or not)
* Literal Patterns (e.g., `5`)
* Data Constructor Patterns (e.g., `Cons(Nil,x)`)
* Underscore Pattern (`_`)

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _CaseExp_ ::= | `case` _PureExp_ `{` { _CaseExpBranch_ } `}`
| _CaseExpBranch_ ::=  | _Pattern_ `\=>` _PureExp_ `;`
| _Pattern_ ::= | `_` +
                 {vbar} __SimpleIdentifier__ +
                 {vbar} __Literal__ +
                 {vbar} __ConstrPattern__
| _ConstrPattern_ ::= | _TypeIdentifier_ [ `(` [ _Pattern_ { `,` _Pattern_ }  ] `)` ]
|====

===== The Variable Pattern

Variable patterns are written as identifiers starting with a lower-case
letter.  If the identifier does not name a variable in the current scope, the
variable pattern matches any value and introducues a binding of the given
identifier to the matched value for the right-hand side of the branch and the
rest of the pattern itself.  In case a binding for that identifier is already
in scope, its value is compared to the value being matched against.

The variable being named by the variable pattern can be used in the
right-hand-side expression of the corresponding branch.  Typically, pattern
variables are used inside of data constructor patterns to extract values from
data constructors.  For example:


[source]
.Example
----
let (Pair<Int, Int> a) = Pair(5, 5) in
  case a {
    Pair(x, x) => x; <1>
    Pair(x, y) => y; <2>
  } <3>
----
<1> This branch matches a pair with identical values.
<2> This branch matches every pair.  Since pairs with identical values are matched by the previous branch, `x` and `y` will be different.
<3> The value of the whole expression is 5, produced by the first branch.


[source]
.Example
----
let (x = 7) in
  case Pair(5, 5) {
    Pair(x, x) => x; <1>
    Pair(x, y) => y; <2>
    Pair(y, z) => z; <3>
  } <4>
----
<1> This pattern does not match since `x` is bound to 7 and does not match 5.
<2> This pattern does not match either, for the same reason.
<3> This pattern contains only unbound variable patterns and therefore matches.
<4> The value of the whole expression is 5, produced by the third branch.



===== The Literal Pattern

Literals can be used as patterns.  The pattern matches if the value of the
case expression is equal to the literal value.

[source]
.Example
----
let (Pair<Int, Int> a) = Pair(5, 5) in
  case a {
    Pair(3, x) => x; <1>
    Pair(x, y) => y; <2>
  } <3>
----
<1> The pattern `3` does not match the value in the first position of the `Pair` constructor pattern.
<2> This pattern matches.
<3> The value of the whole expression is 5, produced by the second branch.


===== The Data Constructor Pattern

A data constructor pattern is written like a standard data constructor expression.
Constructor arguments are again patterns.


[source]
.Example
----
let (List<Int> l) = list[1, 2, 3] in
  case l {
    Nil => 0; <1>
    Cons(1, _) => 15; <2>
    Cons(_, Cons(y, _)) => y; <3>
  } <4>
----
<1> This pattern matches the empty list.
<2> This pattern matches a list starting with the literal `1`.
<3> This pattern matches a list of at least length 2, and binds the second element to `y`.
<4> The value of the whole expression is 15, produced by the second branch.


===== The Wildcard Pattern

The wildcard pattern, written with an underscore (`_`) matches any value.

[source]
.Example
----
let (List<Int> l) = list[1, 2, 3] in
  case l {
    Nil => True; <1>
    _ => False; <2>
}; <3>
----
<1> This pattern matches the empty list.
<2> This pattern matches anything.
<3> The value of the whole expression is `False`, produced by the second branch.

The wildcard pattern can be used as the last pattern in a case expression to
define a default case.


.Typing of Case Expressions

A case expression is type-correct if and only if all its expressions and all
its branches are type-correct and the right-hand side of all branches have a
common super type.  This common super type is also the type of the overall case
expression.  A branch (a pattern and its expression) is type-correct if its
pattern and its right-hand side expression are type-correct.  A pattern is
type-correct if it can match the corresponding case expression.

[[sec:side-effect-expressions]]
=== Expressions with Side Effects

ABS has expressions with side effects.  These expressions are only legal
“stand-alone”, i.e., not as a sub-expression of another expression.  This
means that subexpressions of expressions can only be pure expressions.  This
restriction simplifies the reasoning about expressions in the ABS modeling
language.


[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _EffExp_ ::= | _NewExp_ +
                 {vbar} _SyncCall_ +
                 {vbar} _AsyncCall_ +
                 {vbar} _GetExp_
|====

==== New Expression

A `new` expression creates a new object from a class name and a list of
arguments.  In ABS objects can be created in two different ways.  Either they
are created in the current COG, using the `new local` expression, or they are
created in a new COG by using the `new` expression (see
<<sec:concurrency-model>> for more details about cogs).

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _NewExp_ ::= | `new` [ `local` ] _TypeIdentifier_ `(` [ _PureExp_ {`,` _PureExp_ } ] `)`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
new local Foo(5)
new Bar()
----

Classes can declare an _init block_ (see <<sec:classes>>), which is executed for
each new instance.  The semantics of the `new` expression guarantee that the
init block is fully executed before the new object begins receiving method
calls.  Classes can also declare a `run` method, which is automatically
invoked after the init block and subject to the normal scheduling rules for
processes.


==== Synchronous Call Expression

A synchronous call consists of a target expression evaluating to an interface
type, a method name declared in that interface, and a list of argument expressions.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _SyncCall_ ::= | _PureExp_ `.` _SimpleIdentifier_ `(` _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ } `)`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
Bool b = x.m(5, 3);
----

The semantics of the synchronous method call differ depending on whether the
caller and callee are in the same cog.  A synchronous method call between
objects in the same cog has Java-like semantics, i.e., the caller is suspended
and the called method starts executing immediately.  When the called method
finishes, the caller process is scheduled and resumes execution.

In the case when caller and called object are in different cogs, a synchronous
method call is equivalent to and asynchronous method call immediately followed
by a `get` expression on the resulting future.  This means that the intuitive
semantics of synchronous method calls are preserved, but introduces the
possibility of deadlocks in case the callee tries to call back to an object of
the caller cog.


[[async-call-expression]]
==== Asynchronous Call Expression

An asynchronous call consists of a target expression evaluating to an
interface type, a method name declared in that interface, and a list of
argument expressions.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AsyncCall_ ::= | _PureExp_ `!` _SimpleIdentifier_ `(` _PureExp_ { `,` _PureExp_ }  `)`
|====

An asynchronous method call creates a new task in the COG that contains the
target.  This means that the caller task proceeds independently and in
parallel with the callee task, without waiting for the result.  The result of
evaluating an asynchronous method call expression `o!m(e)` is a _future_ of
type (`Fut<V>`), where `V` is the return type of the callee method `m`.

This future is resolved (i.e., it gets a value) when the callee task finishes.
It can be used to synchronize with the callee task and obtain the result of
the method call.

[source]
.Example
----
Fut<Bool> f = x!m(5);
----

[[get-expression]]
==== Get Expression


A get expression is used to obtain the value from a future.  The current task
is blocked until the future has been resolved, i.e., until either the return
value is available or an exception has occurred in the callee task.  No other
task in the COG can be activated while the current task is blocked by a get
expression.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _GetExp_ ::= | _PureExp_ `.` `get`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
Bool b = f.get;
----

If the future contains a normal return value, the value of the get expression
is that value.  If the future contains an exception thrown by the callee
process, evaluating the get expression will throw the same exception.  The
value thrown by a get expression can be caught by try-catch as normal (see
<<try-catch-finally-stmt>>).

The following example assigns the return value contained in `f` to the
variable `b`.  In case of any error, `b` is assigned `False`.

[source]
.Example
----
try b = f.get; catch { _ => b = False; }
----


[[await-expression]]
==== Await Expression

An await expression is a way to asynchronously call a method, wait for the
callee to finish, and get the result in one expression.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AwaitExp_ ::= | `await` _AsyncCall_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
A x = await o!m();
----

The statement above is equivalent to the three statements in the following example.

[source]
.Example
----
Fut<A> fx = o!m();
await fx?;
A x = fx.get;
----



== Function Definitions

Functions take a list of arguments and evaluate the expression in their body,
producing a return value.  ABS functions are always pure.  This means the body
of a function can use all pure expressions (see <<sec:pure-expressions>>) but
no expressions with side effects (see <<sec:side-effect-expressions>>).


Functions can be _parametric_, which means that they can take and return
parametric datatypes.  This means that a function `head` defined over a
parametric list datatype can return the first element of a list, regardless of
its type.  Parametric functions are defined like normal functions but have an
additional type parameter section inside angle brackets (`<` `>`) after the
function name.


[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _FunctionDecl_  ::= | `def` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ [ `<` _SimpleTypeIdentifier_ { `,` _SimpleTypeIdentifier_ } `>` ] +
                        `(` [ _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ { `,` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_  } ]  `)` +
                        `=` _PureExp_ `;`
|====



[source]
.Example
----
def Rat abs(Rat x) = if x > 0 then x else -x; <1>

def Int length<A>(List<A> list) = <2>
case list {
  Nil => 0;
  Cons(_, ls) => 1 + length(ls);
};

def A head<A>(List<A> list) = <3>
  case list { Cons(x, _) => x; };
----
<1> The `abs` function returns the absolute value of its argument.
<2> This parametric function takes lists with arbitrary values and returns an Integer.
<3> This parametric function returns the same type that is contained in the list.  (Note that `head` is a partial function which is not defined for empty lists.)

NOTE: The ABS standard library contains some special functions that cannot be
defined with pure expressions, for example the function `println`.  Each
special function has to be implemented in each backend.  The details of
implementing special functions are outside of the scope of this manual.

[[sec:partially-defined-functions]]
== Partially Defined Functions

Partial function definitions are function definitions, which take an additional set of parameters that
takes as argument function names. They are used to define a set of functions which only differ in
function applications but share the overall structure. Particularly they offer limited support for
higher-order functions: partially defined functions can be used inside functional code, but cannot
be passed as parameters to other partial function definitions.

A partially defined function is applied the same way as a normal function, but requires that all type
parameters are added explicitly and handles the additional argument set syntactically at compile time.
A normal function definition is generated by replacing the function name (and type) parameters
syntactically by the function names (and types) passed in the application. This is done before type
checking and after delta and trait flattening -- any type mismatch and similar errors are caught
afterwards during type checking.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _PartialFunctionDecl_  ::= | `def` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ [ `<` _SimpleTypeIdentifier_ { `,` _SimpleTypeIdentifier_ } `>` ] +
                        `(` [ _SimpleIdentifier_ { `,` _SimpleIdentifier_  } ]  `)` +
                        `(` [ _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ { `,` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_  } ]  `)` +
                        `=` _PureExp_ `;`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
// Simply applies a function fn to a value.
def B apply<A, B>(fn)(A value) = fn(a);

def Int double(Int x) = x * 2;

{
  // doubled = 4
  Int doubled = apply(double)(2);
}
----

[source]
.Example
----
def Int double(Int x) = x * 2;

{
  // doubled = [2, 4, 6]
  List<Int> doubled = map(double)(list[1, 2, 3]);
}
----

Partial function definitions are defined at module level and can be exported and imported.

NOTE: If multiple statements call a partially defined function with the same function-name arguments, only one expansion is generated.

=== Anonymous Functions

To reduce the need to declare a function with a new function name explicitly every time a partially
defined function is called, ABS uses anonymous functions. +
Anonymous functions are only allowed in the first arguments set of partially defined function calls.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AnonymousFunction_  ::= | `(` [ _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ { `,` _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_  } ]  `)` `=>` _PureExp_ `;`
|====

An anonymous function specifies a number of parameters and an expression that may refer to
the declared parameters.

The following example is equivalent to the previous example, but does not define the `double`
function explicitly.

[source]
.Example
----
{
  List<Int> list = list[1, 2, 3];
  list = map((Int y) => y * 2)(list);
}
----

Anonymous functions are inlined into the expansion of the partial function definition.
Errors caused by wrong typing are caught after the expansion during the type
checking of core ABS, but the expanded function definition has an annotation referring to the
statement that caused the expansion.

When using anonymous functions to instantiate partially defined functions, the expression of the
anonymous function may refer to the fields, parameters and local variables of the context in which
the function is instantiated. In this case the closure is computed and added as additional
parameters to the expanded function definition.
