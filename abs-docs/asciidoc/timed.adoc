== Timed ABS

Timed ABS is an extension to the core ABS language that introduces a notion of
_abstract time_.  Timed ABS can be used to model not only the functional
behavior but also the timing-related behavior of real systems running on real
hardware.  In contrast to real systems, time in an ABS model does not advance
by itself.  The time model of Timed ABS takes inspiration from formalisms such
as http://uppaal.org[Timed Automata] and
http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~peterol/RealTimeMaude/[Real-Time Maude].

NOTE: All untimed ABS models are valid in Timed ABS.  An ABS model that
contains no time-influencing statements will run without influencing the clock
and will finish at time zero.

The ABS notion of time is _dense time_ with _run-to-completion semantics_.
Timed ABS adds a clock to the language semantics that advances in response to
certain language constructs.  Time is expressed as a rational number, so the
clock can advance in infitesimally small steps.


Time only advances when all processes are blocked or suspended and no process
is ready to run.  This means that for time to advance, all processes are in
one of the following states:

* the process is awaiting for a guard that is not enabled (see <<await-stmt>>)
* the process is blocked on a future that is not available (see
  <<get-expression>>)
* the process is suspended waiting for time to advance
* the process is waiting for some resources

In practice this means that all process run as long as there is “work to be
done.”



=== Datatypes and Constructors

Time is expressed as a datatype `Time`.  Its definition in the standard
library is as follows:

[source]
----
data Time = Time(Rat timeValue);
----

=== Functions

The function `now` always returns the current time.

[source]
----
def Time now()
----

Note that since ABS uses simulated time, two calls to `now` can return the same
value.  Specifically, the result of `now()` changes only by executing
`duration` or `await duration` statements, or by waiting for resources to
become available.

[source]
----
  Time t1 = now();
  Int i = pow(2, 50);
  Time t2 = now();
  assert (t1 == t2); <1>
----
<1> This assertion will not fail, since no time has passed in the model.  Time advance in ABS is explicit.



=== Statements

The `duration(min, max)` statement blocks the cog of the executing process
until at least `min` and at most `max` time units have passed.  The `await
duration(min, max)` statement (see <<await-stmt>>) suspends the current
process until at least `min` and at most `max` time units have passed.

.Syntax
|====
| _DurationStmt_ ::= | `duration` `(` _PureExp_ `,` _PureExp_ `)` `;`
| _AwaitStmt_ ::= | `await` _Guard_ `;`
| _Guard_ ::= | ... {vbar} _DurationGuard_
| _DurationGuard_ ::= | `duration` `(` _PureExp_ `,` _PureExp_ `)`
|====


The difference between `duration` and `await duration` is that in the latter
case other processes in the same cog can execute while the awaiting process is
suspended.  In the case of the blocking `duration` statement, no other process
in the same cog can execute.  Note that processes in other cogs are not
influenced by `duration` or `await duration`, except when they attempt to
synchronize with that process.

NOTE: A subtle difference between `duration` and `await duration` is that in
the latter case, the suspended process becomes eligible for scheduling after
the specified time, but there is no guarantee that it will actually be
scheduled at that point.  This means that more time might pass than expressed in the `await duration` guard!

.Examples

----
  Time t = now();
  await duration(1/2, 5); <1>
  Time t2 = now(); <2>
----
<1> Here the *process* suspends for 1/2-5 time units
<2> `t2` will be at least 1/2 time units larger than `t`

----
  Time t = now();
  duration(1/2, 5); <1>
  Time t2 = now(); <2>
----
<1> Here the *cog* blocks for 1/2-5 time units
<2> `t2` will be between 1/2 and 5 time units larger than `t`

=== Semantics of Time Advancement

The simulated clock advances such that it makes the least amount of “jumps”
without missing any point of interest.  This means that when a process waits
or blocks for an interval _(min, max)_, the clock will not advance more than
_max_, since otherwise it would miss unblocking the process.  On the other
hand, the clock will advance by the highest amount allowed by the model.  This
means that if only one process waits for _(min, max)_, the clock will advance
by _max_.

Figure <<fig-time-advance>> shows a timeline with two process, `P1` and `P2`.
They are waiting for time to advance between `(4, 6)` and `(3, 5)` units,
respectively.  Assuming that no other process is ready to run, the clock will
advance the maximum amount that still hits the earliest interval, in this
case 5.  Since the clock is now within both intervals, both processes are
unblocked and ready to run.
