== Feature Modelling

=== Deltas

ABS supports the delta-oriented programming model, an approach that aids the
development of a set of programs simultaneously from a single code base,
following the software product line engineering approach.  In delta-oriented
programming, features defined by a feature model are associated with code
modules that describe modifications to a core program.  In ABS, these modules
are called _delta modules_. Hence the implementation of a software product
line in ABS is divided into a _core_ and a set of delta modules.

The core consists of a set of ABS modules that implement a complete software
product of the corresponding software product line.  Delta modules (or
_deltas_ in short) describe how to change the core program to obtain new
products.  This includes adding new classes and interfaces, modifying existing
ones, or even removing some classes from the core.  Delta modules can also
modify the functional entities of an ABS program, that is, they can add and
modify data types and type synonyms, and add functions.

Deltas are applied to the core program by the ABS compiler front end. The
choice of which delta modules to apply depends on the selection of a set of
features, that is, a particular product of the SPL.  The role of the ABS
compiler front end is to translate textual ABS models into an internal
representation and check the models for syntax and semantic errors.  The role
of the back ends is to generate code for the models targeting some suitable
execution or simulation environment.

----

The `DeltaDecl` clause specifies the syntax of delta modules, consisting of a
unique identifier, a module access directive, a list of parameters and a
sequence of module modifiers.  The _module access_ directive gives the delta
access to the namespace of a particular module.  In other words, it specifies
the ABS module to which modifications using unqualified identifiers apply by
default.  A delta can still make changes to several modules by fully
qualifying the `TypeName` of module modifiers.

While delta modelling supports a broad range of ways to modify an ABS model,
not all ABS program entities are modifiable.  These unsupported modifications
are listed here for completeness.  While these modifications could be easily
specified and implemented, we opted not to overload the language with features
that have not been regarded as necessary in practice:

Class parameters and init block::
Deltas currently do not support the modification of class parameter lists or
class init blocks.
Deltas::
currently only support adding functions, and adding and modifying data types
and type synonyms. Removal is not supported.
Modules::
Deltas currently do not support adding new modules or removing modules.
Imports and Exports::
While deltas do support the addition of import and export statements to
modules, they do not support their modification or removal.
Main block::
Deltas currently do not support the modification of the programâ€™s main block.



=== Products and Product Lines

ABS provides language constructs and tools for modelling variable systems
following Software Product Line (SPL) engineering practices.

Software variability is commonly expressed using features which can be present
or absent from a product of the product line.  Features are organised in a
feature model, which is essentially a set of logical constraints expressing
the dependencies between features.  Thus the feature model defines a set of
legal feature combinations, which represent the set of valid software products
that can be built from the given features.

==== Specifying the Product Line

The ABS configuration language links feature models, which describe the
structure of a SPL, to delta modules, which implement behaviour.  The
configuration defines, for each selection of features satisfied by the product
selection, which delta modules should be applied to the core.  Furthermore, it
guides the code generation by ordering the application of the delta modules.

[source]
----
Configuration ::= 'productline' TypeId ';' Features ';' DeltaClause*
Features      ::='features' FName (',' FName)*
DeltaClause   ::= 'delta' DeltaSpec [AfterCondition] [ApplicationCondition] ';'
DeltaSpec     ::= DeltaName ['(' DeltaParams ')']
DeltaName     ::= TypeId
DeltaParams   ::= DeltaParam (',' DeltaParam)*
DeltaParam    ::= FName | FName'.'AName
AfterClause   ::= 'after' DeltaName (',' DeltaName)*
WhenClause    ::= 'when' AppCond 
AppCond       ::= AppCond '&&' AppCond 
                | AppCond '||' AppCond  
                | '!' AppCond  
                | '(' AppCond ')' 
                | FName
----


Features and delta modules are associated through _application conditions_,
which are logical expressions over the set of features and attributes in a
feature model. The collection of applicable delta modules is given by the
application conditions that are true for a particular feature and attribute
selection. By not associating the delta modules directly with features, a
degree of flexibility is obtained.

Each delta clause has a `DeltaSpec`, specifying the name of a delta module
name and, optionally, a list of parameters; an `AfterClause`, specifying the
delta modules that the current delta must be applied after; and an application
condition `AppCond`, specifying an arbitrary predicate over the feature names
(`FName`) and attribute names (`AName`) in the feature model that describes
when the given delta module is applied.

----
productline DeltaResourceExample;
features Cost, NoCost, NoDeploymentScenario, UnlimitedMachines, LimitedMachines, Wordcount, Wordsearch;
delta DOccurrences when Wordsearch;
delta DFixedCost(Cost.cost) when Cost;
delta DUnboundedDeployment(UnlimitedMachines.capacity) when UnlimitedMachines;
delta DBoundedDeployment(LimitedMachines.capacity, LimitedMachines.machinelimit) when LimitedMachines;

==== Specifying Products

ABS allows the developer to name products that are of particular interest, in
order to easily refer to them later when the actual code needs to be
generated. A product definition states which features are to be included in
the product and sets attributes of those features to concrete values. In the simplest
case products are declared directly, by listing the features that they include.
It is also possible to declare products based on other products using 
`product expressions`. Product expressions use set-theoretic operations (union, 
intersection, complement) over products and sets of features.


[source]
----
Selection ::= 'product' TypeId ( '(' FeatureSpecs ')' ';' | '=' ProductExpr ';' )
ProductExpr: '{' FeatureSpecs '}'
			| ProductExpr '&&' ProductExpr
			| ProductExpr '||' ProductExpr
			| ProductExpr '-' ProductExpr
			| TypeId
			| '(' ProductExpr ')'
FeatureSpecs ::= FeatureSpec (',' FeatureSpec)*
FeatureSpec ::= FName [AttributeAssignments]
AttributeAssignments ::= '{' AttributeAssignment (',' AttributeAssignment '}'
AttributeAssignment ::= AName '=' Literal

Here are some product definitions for the `DeltaResourceExample` productline:

[source]
----
product WordcountModel (Wordcount, NoCost, NoDeploymentScenario);
product WordcountFull (Wordcount, Cost{cost=10}, UnlimitedMachines{capacity=20});
product WordsearchFull (Wordsearch, Cost{cost=10}, UnlimitedMachines{capacity=20});
product WordsearchDemo (Wordsearch, Cost{cost=10}, LimitedMachines{capacity=20, machinelimit=2});

Here are some product definitions for the `CharityOrganizationExample` with ProductExpr:

[source]
----
product Org1 = SekolahBermainMatahari || {Continuous};
product Org2 = SekolahBermainMatahari || {Continuous, Automatic_Report};
product Org3 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU;
product Org4 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU || RamadhanForKids;
product Org5 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU || RamadhanForKids || BeriBuku;
product Org6 = SekolahBermainMatahari && RamadhanForKids;
product Org7 = SekolahBermainMatahari && BeriBuku;
product Org8 = SekolahBermainMatahari - {Eventual};
product Org9 = SekolahBermainMatahari - {Eventual, Income};
product Org10 = SekolahBermainMatahari && RamadhanForKids || {Money, Item};
product Org11 = SekolahBermainMatahari && (RamadhanForKids || {Money, Item});

==== The Feature Model

The `FeatureModel` clause specifies a number of "orthogonal" root feature
models along with a number of extensions that specify additional constraints,
typically cross-tree dependencies.  Its grammar is as follows:

[source]
----
FeatureModel ::= ('root' FeatureDecl)* FeatureExtension*
FeatureDecl  ::= FName [ '{' [Group] AttributeDecl* Constraint* '}' ]
FeatureExtension ::= 'extension' FName '{' AttributeDecl* Constraint* '}'
Group ::= 'group' Cardinality '{' ['opt'] FeatureDecl (',' ['opt'] FeatureDecl)* '}'
Cardinality ::= 'allof' | 'oneof' | '[' IntLiteral '..' Limit ']'
AttributeDecl ::= 'Int' AName ';'
                | 'Int' AName in '[' Limit '..' Limit ']' ';'
                | 'Bool' AName ';'
                | 'String' AName ';'
Limit ::= IntLiteral | '*'
Constraint ::= Expr ';'
             | 'ifin'':'  Expr ';'
             | 'ifout'':' Expr ';'
             | 'require'':' FName ';'
             | 'exclude'':' FName ';'
Expr ::= 'True'
       | 'False'
       | IntLiteral
       | StringLiteral
       | FName
       | AName
       | FName '.'AName
       | UnOp Expr
       | Expr BinOp Expr
       | '(' Expr ')'
UnOp ::= '!' | '-'
BinOp ::= '||' | '&&' | '->' | '<->' | '=='
        | '!=' | '>'  | '<'  | '>='  | '<='
        | '+'  | '-'  | '*'  | '/'   | '%'
----

Attributes and values range over integers, strings or booleans.

The `FeatureDecl` clause specifies the details of a given feature, firstly by
giving it a name (`FName`), followed by a number of possibly optional
sub-features, the feature's attributes and any relevant constraints.

The `FeatureExtension` clause specifies additional constraints and attributes
for a feature, and if the extended feature has no children a group can also be
specified.  This is particularly useful for specifying constraints that do not
fit into the tree structure given by the root feature model.

Here is an example feature model for the `DeltaResourceExample` productline,
defining valid combinations of features and valid ranges of parameters for
cost, capacity and number of machines:

[source]
----
root Calculations {
  group oneof {
    Wordcount,
    Wordsearch
  }
}

root Resources {
  group oneof {
    NoCost,
    Cost { Int cost in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ; }
  }
}

root Deployments {
  group oneof {
    NoDeploymentScenario,
    UnlimitedMachines { Int capacity in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ; },
    LimitedMachines { Int capacity in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ;
      Int machinelimit in [ 0 .. 100 ] ; }
  }    
}
----

==== Feature Model Reflection

There is support for limited reflection on the feature model and configured
product in the module `ABS.Productline`.  The datatype `Feature` contains
constructors for all feature names.  The function `product_features` returns a
list of features contained in the current product, and `product_name` returns
the name of the product, or the empty string if no product was specified.

The following sample code shows the usage, assuming that product `Product` was
generated:

[source]
----
module Test;
import * from ABS.Productline;

{
  List<Feature> foo = product_features(); // => Cons(FeatureA, Cons(FeatureC, Nil)) 
  String name = product_name();           // => "Product"
}

productline Test;
features FeatureA, FeatureB, FeatureC;

product Product(FeatureA, FeatureC);
