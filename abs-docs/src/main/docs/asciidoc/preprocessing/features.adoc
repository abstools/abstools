== Feature Modelling

ABS provides language constructs and tools for modelling variable systems
following Software Product Line (SPL) engineering practices.

Software variability is commonly expressed using features which can be present
or absent from a product of the product line.  Features are organised in a
feature model, which is essentially a set of logical constraints expressing
the dependencies between features.  Thus the feature model defines a set of
legal feature combinations, which represent the set of valid software products
that can be built from the given features.

=== Specifying the Product Line

The ABS configuration language links feature models, which describe the
structure of a SPL, to delta modules, which implement behaviour.  The
configuration defines, for each selection of features satisfied by the product
selection, which delta modules should be applied to the core.  Furthermore, it
guides the code generation by ordering the application of the delta modules.

----
Configuration ::= 'productline' TypeId ';' Features ';' DeltaClause*
Features      ::='features' FName (',' FName)*
DeltaClause   ::= 'delta' DeltaSpec [AfterCondition] [ApplicationCondition] ';'
DeltaSpec     ::= DeltaName ['(' DeltaParams ')']
DeltaName     ::= TypeId
DeltaParams   ::= DeltaParam (',' DeltaParam)*
DeltaParam    ::= FName | FName'.'AName
AfterClause   ::= 'after' DeltaName (',' DeltaName)*
WhenClause    ::= 'when' AppCond 
AppCond       ::= AppCond '&&' AppCond 
                | AppCond '||' AppCond  
                | '!' AppCond  
                | '(' AppCond ')' 
                | FName
----


Features and delta modules are associated through _application conditions_,
which are logical expressions over the set of features and attributes in a
feature model. The collection of applicable delta modules is given by the
application conditions that are true for a particular feature and attribute
selection. By not associating the delta modules directly with features, a
degree of flexibility is obtained.

Each delta clause has a `DeltaSpec`, specifying the name of a delta module
name and, optionally, a list of parameters; an `AfterClause`, specifying the
delta modules that the current delta must be applied after; and an application
condition `AppCond`, specifying an arbitrary predicate over the feature names
(`FName`) and attribute names (`AName`) in the feature model that describes
when the given delta module is applied.

productline DeltaResourceExample;
features Cost, NoCost, NoDeploymentScenario, UnlimitedMachines, LimitedMachines, Wordcount, Wordsearch;
delta DOccurrences when Wordsearch;
delta DFixedCost(Cost.cost) when Cost;
delta DUnboundedDeployment(UnlimitedMachines.capacity) when UnlimitedMachines;
delta DBoundedDeployment(LimitedMachines.capacity, LimitedMachines.machinelimit) when LimitedMachines;

=== Specifying Products

ABS allows the developer to name products that are of particular interest, in
order to easily refer to them later when the actual code needs to be
generated.  A product definition states with product expression from operator intersection,
operator union, operator difference, product name, parenthesis, or features are to be included in
the product and sets attributes of those features to concrete values.

[source]
----
Selection ::= 'product' TypeId
			 (
			  '(' FeatureSpecs ')' ';'
			 |
			  '=' ProductExpr ';'
			 )
ProductExpr: '{' FeatureSpecs '}'
			| leftOperand=ProductExpr '&&' rightOperand=ProductExpr
			| leftOperand=ProductExpr '||' rightOperand=ProductExpr
			| leftOperand=ProductExpr '-' rightOperand=ProductExpr
			| TypeId
			| '(' ProductExpr ')'
FeatureSpecs ::= FeatureSpec (',' FeatureSpec)*
FeatureSpec ::= FName [AttributeAssignments]
AttributeAssignments ::= '{' AttributeAssignment (',' AttributeAssignment '}'
AttributeAssignment ::= AName '=' Literal

Here are some product definitions for the `DeltaResourceExample` productline:

[source]
----
product WordcountModel (Wordcount, NoCost, NoDeploymentScenario);
product WordcountFull (Wordcount, Cost{cost=10}, UnlimitedMachines{capacity=20});
product WordsearchFull (Wordsearch, Cost{cost=10}, UnlimitedMachines{capacity=20});
product WordsearchDemo (Wordsearch, Cost{cost=10}, LimitedMachines{capacity=20, machinelimit=2});

Here are some product definitions for the `CharityOrganizationExample` with ProductExpr:

[source]
----
product Org1 = SekolahBermainMatahari || {Continuous};
product Org2 = SekolahBermainMatahari || {Continuous, Automatic_Report};
product Org3 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU;
product Org4 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU || RamadhanForKids;
product Org5 = SekolahBermainMatahari || PKPU || RamadhanForKids || BeriBuku;
product Org6 = SekolahBermainMatahari && RamadhanForKids;
product Org7 = SekolahBermainMatahari && BeriBuku;
product Org8 = SekolahBermainMatahari - {Eventual};
product Org9 = SekolahBermainMatahari - {Eventual, Income};
product Org10 = SekolahBermainMatahari && RamadhanForKids || {Money, Item};
product Org11 = SekolahBermainMatahari && (RamadhanForKids || {Money, Item});

=== The Feature Model

The `FeatureModel` clause specifies a number of "orthogonal" root feature
models along with a number of extensions that specify additional constraints,
typically cross-tree dependencies.  Its grammar is as follows:

[source]
----
FeatureModel ::= ('root' FeatureDecl)* FeatureExtension*
FeatureDecl  ::= FName [ '{' [Group] AttributeDecl* Constraint* '}' ]
FeatureExtension ::= 'extension' FName '{' AttributeDecl* Constraint* '}'
Group ::= 'group' Cardinality '{' ['opt'] FeatureDecl (',' ['opt'] FeatureDecl)* '}'
Cardinality ::= 'allof' | 'oneof' | '[' IntLiteral '..' Limit ']'
AttributeDecl ::= 'Int' AName ';'
                | 'Int' AName in '[' Limit '..' Limit ']' ';'
                | 'Bool' AName ';'
                | 'String' AName ';'
Limit ::= IntLiteral | '*'
Constraint ::= Expr ';'
             | 'ifin'':'  Expr ';'
             | 'ifout'':' Expr ';'
             | 'require'':' FName ';'
             | 'exclude'':' FName ';'
Expr ::= 'True'
       | 'False'
       | IntLiteral
       | StringLiteral
       | FName
       | AName
       | FName '.'AName
       | UnOp Expr
       | Expr BinOp Expr
       | '(' Expr ')'
UnOp ::= '!' | '-'
BinOp ::= '||' | '&&' | '->' | '<->' | '=='
        | '!=' | '>'  | '<'  | '>='  | '<='
        | '+'  | '-'  | '*'  | '/'   | '%'
----

Attributes and values range over integers, strings or booleans.

The `FeatureDecl` clause specifies the details of a given feature, firstly by
giving it a name (`FName`), followed by a number of possibly optional
sub-features, the feature's attributes and any relevant constraints.

The `FeatureExtension` clause specifies additional constraints and attributes
for a feature, and if the extended feature has no children a group can also be
specified.  This is particularly useful for specifying constraints that do not
fit into the tree structure given by the root feature model.

Here is an example feature model for the `DeltaResourceExample` productline,
defining valid combinations of features and valid ranges of parameters for
cost, capacity and number of machines:

[source]
----
root Calculations {
  group oneof {
    Wordcount,
    Wordsearch
  }
}

root Resources {
  group oneof {
    NoCost,
    Cost { Int cost in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ; }
  }
}

root Deployments {
  group oneof {
    NoDeploymentScenario,
    UnlimitedMachines { Int capacity in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ; },
    LimitedMachines { Int capacity in [ 0 .. 10000 ] ;
      Int machinelimit in [ 0 .. 100 ] ; }
  }    
}
----

=== Feature Model Reflection

There is support for limited reflection on the feature model and configured
product in the module `ABS.Productline`.  The datatype `Feature` contains
constructors for all feature names.  The function `product_features` returns a
list of features contained in the current product, and `product_name` returns
the name of the product, or the empty string if no product was specified.

The following sample code shows the usage, assuming that product `Product` was
generated:

[source]
----
module Test;
import * from ABS.Productline;

{
  List<Feature> foo = product_features(); // => Cons(FeatureA, Cons(FeatureC, Nil)) 
  String name = product_name();           // => "Product"
}

productline Test;
features FeatureA, FeatureB, FeatureC;

product Product(FeatureA, FeatureC);
