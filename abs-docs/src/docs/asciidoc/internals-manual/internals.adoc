.About this guide

This guide is meant to help document how absc -- the ABS compiler -- works, as
well as to help new contributors get involved in development, and for using
ABS as basis for their own research.  It is meant as a high-level overview,
presenting the kinds of things that (ideally) do not change frequently.

Part 1 contains general information that should be useful no matter how you
are contributing.  Part 2 contains information about how various parts of the
compiler work.

This guide is currently a work-in-progress.  Contributions and corrections to
this guide are very welcome!

== How absc works

=== High-level overview of the compiler source

=== The command-line parser and dispatcher

The main entry point of the compiler is the class `org.abs_models.Absc`.  This class parses command-line arguments, parses the files given on the command line and dispatches to the desired backend.  There is also a possibility to register _sub-commands_ for distinct functionality; for example, software product line type checking is done by invoking the `checkspl` subcommand.  Subcommands have their own command-line options and help output.

The `Absc` class uses https://picocli.info[the picocli library] for command-line parsing.

=== Lexing and parsing

We currently use antlr4 for parsing ABS source code.  The grammar is at `frontend/src/main/antlr/org/abs_models/frontend/antlr/parser/ABS.g4`.

=== Abstract syntax tree rewriting

We use http://jastadd.org/web/[JastAdd] for the AST.  The AST node definitions for Core ABS are in `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/ast/CoreAbs.ast`; AST node definitions for Full ABS are in `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/ast/FullAbs.ast`.

The antlr parse tree is converted into JastAdd by the class `org.abs_models.frontend.antlr.parser.CreateJastAddASTListener`.

Tree attributes and aspects (for type checking, code generation etc.) are added via `.jadd` and `.jrag` files; these files can be added in any directory below `frontend/src/main/java`.

=== Typechecking

Code below `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/`.

Type checking is done in
`org.abs_models.frontend.parser:analyzeFlattenAndRewriteModel`, which should
be called by all backends.  For historical reasons, there are two passes of
type checking: `Model.getErrors` and `Main.typeCheckModel`.  The latter method
nrelies on some errors not being present that are detected by the former one,
so they should always be called in the same sequence as in
`analyzeFlattenAndRewriteModel`.

Types are represented as their own class hierarchy, separate from the AST node
classes.  See
`frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/Type.java` and its
subclasses.

Many AST nodes can calculate information about their type, via the `getType`
method that returns a `Type` object.  This is implemented in
`frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/Typing.jrag`

Type checking itself uses `Type` objects and the `getType` method to collect
type errors.  The methods `typeCheck` fill a `SemanticConditionList` with
`SemanticCondition` objects.

==== Type checker extensions

Note the possibility to write type checker extensions; see the `frontend/src/main/java/org/abs_models/frontend/typechecker/ext/` directory.

To implement a new type system extension, inherit from
`DefaultTypeSystemExtension` and override some of its methods.  Then, register
the extension by adding it to the `registerDefaultExtensions` method of the
`TypeExtensionHelper` class.

=== Backends and code generation

== The Erlang backend

=== Code Generation

The main entry point of the Erlang code generation system is the method `org.abs_models.backend.erlang.ErlangBackend.doMain`, which will be invoked by the `Absc` class.  Given a type-checked and preprocessed AST, the Erlang backend generates code in a subdirectory (by default `gen/erl/`) and then invokes the Erlang compiler.

The `gen/erl/` directory is pre-populated with the contents of `frontend/src/main/resources/erlang`, which includes both ABS runtime files in the subdirectory `absmodel/src/` and third-party support libraries below `absmodel/deps/`.

=== The Runtime System

== The Java backend

=== Code Generation

=== The Runtime System

==== ABS Classes, Datatypes in Java

The ABS standard library pre-defines various functions, classes,
datatypes etc.  Depending on the usage pattern, there are various ways of
making them available to the Java backend at compile time.

- Built-in functions: These functions must be defined per backend.  The Java
  backend defines these functions in the file `ABSBuiltInFunctions.java`.
- Primitive datatypes: `Bool`, `String` and `Float` are translated to
  their Java counterparts.  `Unit` is used as-is, `Int` and `Rat` are
  translated to types from the Apfloat library.  The other types
  (`Unit`, `Fut<A>`) are implemented as subclasses of
  `ABSBuiltinDatatype`.
- Using other ABS functions, datatypes, classes etc. from Java: This can be
  done via reflection; see `ABSDCMirror.java` for an example.

==== Task Scheduling and Execution

A running ABS model has a singleton class of type
`org.abs_models.backend.java.lib.runtime.ABSRuntime` or one of its subclasses.

Each cog is an instance of `org.abs_models.backend.java.lib.runtime.COG`.
Each cog has one associated instance of type
`org.abs_models.backend.java.scheduling.TaskScheduler`, by default this is
`org.abs_models.backend.java.scheduling.DefaultTaskScheduler` but this is customizable by the user.

In the following, we describe the behavior of `DefaultTaskScheduler`;
reverse-engineering `SimpleTaskScheduler` remains to be done.

`DefaultTaskScheduler` contains an inner class `SchedulerThread`.  Instances
of this class run ABS tasks, each running ABS process is handled by a Java
thread of this class.  `SchedulerThread` instances are re-used: if a thread
terminates, it checks for fresh tasks (in field `newTasks`) and starts running
one; if there are no new tasks available, the thread terminates.

A `SchedulerThread` instance is created either by the method
`SchedulerThread.addTask` (if no task is running), or by a running
`SchedulerThread` when the running thread suspends.  The running thread will
not create a fresh thread when its task terminates; instead, it will pick up a
waiting task and execute it.

The "token" or lock of the cog is the field `runningThread`.  This field
contains the running thread, or `null` if the cog has no running thread.  When
encountering a scheduling point, the running thread sets this field to `null`
and notifies all threads, which race to check if the lock `runningThread` is
available and their guard evaluates to `true`.

==== Timed Semantics

Each cog contains a counter `activeThreads` that is increased and decreased as
processes suspend and wake up via the cog methods `notifyAwait`,
`notifyWakeup`.  A guard's `await` method will call these methods let the cog
know about the task's status (runnable or not).  Care must be taken to only
call `await` on a guard when actually awaiting for the purpose of making a
scheduling decision, and call the method `isTrue` when checking for a guard's
status outside of scheduling.

A cog deems itself to be inactive in two cases when receiving `notifyAwait`:
- Its `activeThreads` counter is `0` (all tasks are suspended)
- Its scheduler returns non-`null` from `getActiveTask` (the active task is
  blocked).

Upon becoming inactive, the cog will signal the `ABSRuntime` singleton via the
methods `notifyCogActive`, `notifyCogInactive`.  The runtime keeps track of
the amount to increase the clock in the variable `wake_time`.  When the number
of active cogs reaches zero, the runtime will try to increase the clock; this
happens only when one or more `ABSDurationGuard` guards have registered
themselves via `addDurationGuard`.  If so, the runtime increases the clock and
notifies (as with `Object.notify`) the guards whose `min_time` is less than or
equal to the current clock.  A duration guard, once notified, will notify its
cog that the task is ready to run and return from its `await` method (which
was called from the `SchedulerThread` running the ABS task).
