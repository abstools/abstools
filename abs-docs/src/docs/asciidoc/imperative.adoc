=== Skip

The skip statement is a statement that does nothing.

| _SkipStmt_ ::= | `skip` `;`

skip;

=== Variable Declarations

A variable declaration statement is used to declare variables.  Variable
declarations can occur at any point in a sequence of statements; i.e., it is
not necessary to declare variables only at the beginning of methods or blocks.

Variables declared inside a block are in scope for the duration of the block.
It is an error to declare a variable with the same name of another variable in
scope.  A local variable can have the same name as an object field.

A variable declaration has an expression that defines the initial value of the
variable.  The initialization expression is mandatory except for variables of
reference types (interfaces and futures), in which case the variable is
initialized with `null` if the initialization expression is omitted.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _VarDeclStmt_ ::= | _Type_ _SimpleIdentifier_ [ `=` _Exp_ ] `;`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
Bool b = True;
----

==== Constant Declarations

Variable and field declarations can carry a `Final` annotation.  the effect of
such an annotation is to forbid re-assignment to such variables.

The following example will lead to a compile-time error since we are trying to
assign a new value to `constant_i`:

[source]
.Example
----
{
    [Final] Int constant_i = 24;
    constant_i = 25;
}
----



=== Assignment

The assign statement assigns a value to a variable or a field.

Assignments to a field `f` can be written either `this.f = e;` or `f = e;`.
In case a local variable `f` is in scope at the point of the assignment
statement, the `this` prefix has to be used to assign to the field `f`; assignment
to `f` will change the value of the local variable.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AssignStmt_ ::= | [ `this` `.` ] _SimpleIdentifier_ `=` _Exp_ `;`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
this.f = True;
x = 5;
----


=== Expressions as Statements

An expression statement is a statement that consists of a single expression.
When an expression statement is executed, the expression is evaluated and the
resulting value is discarded.

Expression statements are used for their side effects, for example issuing an
asynchronous method call without waiting for its result.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _ExpStmt_ ::= | _Exp_ `;`
|====

NOTE: Creating an object without storing a reference (and hence never invoking
a method on the new object) can be a meaningful operation, for example when
the object has a `run` method and interacts with the rest of the system by
calling methods on references passed in via the `new` expression.

[source]
.Example
----
server!operate();
new Client(server);
----


=== Assertions

An assert statement is a statement for asserting certain conditions.  If the
expression evaluates to `True`, executing an assertion is equivalent to
`skip;`.  If the expression evaluates to `False`, it is equivalent to `throw
AssertionFailException;`.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AssertStmt_ ::= | `assert` _PureExp_ `;`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
assert x != null;
----



[[await-stmt]]
=== Await Statement

An await statement suspends the current task until the given guard becomes
active (evaluates to `True`).  While the task is suspended, other tasks within
the same COG can be scheduled.

Guards can wait for a futures to become resolved, for a Boolean condition over
the object state to become true, or (in timed ABS) for a certain duration to
pass.

In general, each cog will continue running a task without preempting it until
the task is finished or it reaches a _scheduling point_.  Await statements are
scheduling points, as are `suspend` statements and assignment or expression
statements containing an await expression (see <<await-expression>>).

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _AwaitStmt_ ::= | `await` _Guard_ `;`
| _Guard_ ::= | [ `this` `.` ] _SimpleIdentifier_ `?` +
{vbar} _PureExp_ +
{vbar} _Guard_ `&` _Guard_ +
{vbar} `duration` `(` _PureExp_ `,` _PureExp_ `)`
|====

[source]
.Example
----
Fut<Bool> f = x!m();
await f?; <1>
await this.x == True; <2>
await f? & this.y > 5; <3>
await duration(3, 5); <4>
----
<1> A _claim guard_ becomes active when the future is resolved (contains a value or an exception).
<2> A _field guard_ is a Boolean expression over the object state.
<3> A _guard conjunction_ becomes active when both its components are active.
<4> A _duration guard_ becomes active after a certain amount of simulated time has passed.  See <<sec:timed-abs>> for more on timed models.


[[suspend-stmt]]
=== Unconditional Release: Suspend

The suspend statement causes the current task to be suspended.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _SuspendStmt_ ::= | `suspend` `;`
|====

NOTE: There is no guarantee that the cog will choose another task to run; the
current task might be resumed immediately after suspending itself.

WARNING: It is tempting to misuse the `suspend` statement for
busy-waiting (`while (!condition) suspend; doTheThing();`).  In all
cases, it is better to await on the condition: `await condition; doTheThing();`.


[source]
.Example
----
suspend;
----



=== Return

A return statement returns a value from a method.  A return statement can only
appear as a last statement in a method body.

For asynchronous method calls, executing the return statement will cause the
future to be resolved so that it contains a value.  Any claim guards awaiting
the future will become active.

Methods that have a `Unit` return type do not need an explicit return
statement.  The future will be resolved when the method terminates.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _ReturnStmt_ ::= | `return` _Exp_ `;`
|====

NOTE: ABS does not allow exiting a method from multiple points, e.g., via
multiple `return` statements.  This makes model analysis easier.

[source]
.Example
----
return x;
----

[[throw-statement]]
=== Throw

The statement `throw` signals an exception (see <<sec:exception-types>>).  It
takes a single argument of type `ABS.StdLib.Exception`, which is the exception
value to throw.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _ThrowStmt_ ::= | `throw` _PureExp_ `;`
|====



[source]
.Example
----
  throw AssertionFailException;
----

Note that the 'throw' statement can only be used inside imperative code.
Functional code that cannot return a value in all cases should use the `Maybe`
datatype.

----
def Maybe<Int> f(Int x, Int y) = if (y < 0) then None else Just(x);
----

Furthermore, note that some built-in exceptions, like
`DivisionByZeroException` and `PatternMatchFailException` can originate from
functional code.  See <<stdlib:predefined-exceptions>> for a list of built-in
exceptions.


=== Blocks of Statements

A sequence of statements is called a _block_.  A block introduces a scope for
local variables.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _Block_ ::= | `{` { _Statement_ } `}`
|====

NOTE: Semantically, a whole block is a single statement and can be written
anywhere a single statement is valid.

[source]
.Example
----
{
  Int a = 0; <1>
  a = a + 1;
  n = a % 10;
}

{ } <2>
----
<1> The variable `a` is in scope until the end of the block.
<2> An empty block is equivalent to `skip;`.


=== Conditionals

ABS has the standard conditional statement.  The condition has to evaluate to
a Boolean value.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _IfStmt_ ::= | `if` `(` _PureExp_ `)` _Stmt_ [ `else` _Stmt_ ]
|====



[source]
.Example
----
if (5 < x) {
  y = 6;
}
else {
  y = 7;
}
if (True)
  x = 5;
----

[[switch-stmt]]
=== Switch: Pattern Matching

The switch statement, like the case expression (see <<case-expression>>),
consists of an expression and a series of branches, each consisting of a
pattern and a statement (which can be a block).

When a switch statement is executed, its input expression is evaluated and the
value matched against the branches until a matching pattern is found.  The
statement in the right-hand side of that branch is then executed.  Any
variable bindings introduced by matching the pattern are in effect while
executing that statement.

If no pattern matches the expression, a `PatternMatchFailException` is thrown.

For a description of the pattern syntax, see <<case-expression>>.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _SwitchStmt_ ::= | `switch` `(` _PureExp_ `)` `{` { _SwitchStmtBranch_ } `}`
| _SwitchStmtBranch_ ::= | _Pattern_ `\=>` _Stmt_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
Pair<Int, Int> p = Pair(2, 3);
Int x = 0;
switch (p) {
  Pair(2, y) => { x = y; skip; }
  _ => x = -1;
}
----



=== The While Loop

The while loop repeats its body while the condition evaluates to `True`.  The
condition is re-evaluated after each iteration of the loop.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _WhileStmt_ ::= | `while` `(` _PureExp_ `)` _Stmt_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
while (x < 5) {
  x = x + 1;
}
----

[[foreach-loop]]
=== The Foreach Loop

The foreach loop repeatedly executes its body with a loop value variable bound
to each element of the given list, in sequence.  An optional loop index
variable is bound to the index of the element bound to the value variable,
starting with 0.

The rules for the loop variables follow the rules of local variable
declarations in blocks: the loop variables cannot shadow existing variables,
but can use the same name as an object field.  Loop variables go out of scope
after execution leaves the body of their foreach loop.

NOTE: Also see the second-order functions `map`, `filter`, `foldl` and `foldr`
in Section <<type-list>> for common list processing idioms.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _ForeachStmt_ ::= | `foreach` `(` _Identifier_ [ `,` _identifier_] `in` _PureExp_ `)` _Stmt_
|====

[source]
.Example
----
foreach (v in list["a", "b", "c"]) {
  println(`v is bound to $v$`);
}

foreach (v, i in list["a", "b", "c"]) {
  println(`Element number $i$ has value $v$`);
}
----


[[try-catch-finally-stmt]]
=== Handling Exceptions with Try-Catch-Finally

Executing a statement can result in an exception, either explicitly signaled
using the `throw` keyword or implicitly, for example by dividing by zero.  The
try-catch-finally statement is used to handle exceptions and resume normal
execution afterwards.

[frame=topbot, options="noheader", grid=none, caption="", cols=">30,<70"]
.Syntax
|====
| _TryCatchFinallyStmt_ ::= | `try` _Stmt_ +
                              `catch` ( `{` { _SwitchStmtBranch_ } `}`  {vbar} _SwitchStmtBranch_ ) +
                              [ `finally` _Stmt_ ]
|====

The statement protected by `try` (which can be a block) is executed first.  If
no exception is thrown, execution continues with the optional `finally`
statement, then with the next statement after the try-catch-finally statement.

If during execution of the statement protected by `try` an exception is
thrown, it is matched one-by-one against the exception patterns defined in the
`catch` block.  The statement following the first matching pattern will be
executed, as in the switch statement (see <<switch-stmt>>).  Execution continues
with the optional `finally` statement, then with the statement following the
try-catch-finally statement.


If during execution of the statement protected by `try` an exception is thrown
that is not matched by any branch in the `catch` block, the exception is
_unhandled_.  In this case, first the optional `finally` statement is
executed.  If the try-catch-finally was protected by another try-catch-finally
statement, the unhandled exception is passed on to this surrounding
try-catch-finally statement.  Otherwise, the current process terminates and
its future is resolved by storing the unhandled exception.  Any `get`
expression on this future will re-throw the exception (see
<<get-expression>>).  The object that ran the aborted process will execute its
recovery block with the unhandled exception as parameter (see
<<sec:classes>>).

.Example
[source]
----
try {
    Rat z = 1/x; <1>
} catch {
    DivisionByZeroException => println("We divided by zero"); <2>
} finally {
    println("Leaving the protected area"); <3>
}
----
<1> If `x` is zero, this will throw an exception
<2> Division by zero is handled here; other exceptions will be left unhandled
<3> This statement is always executed

As a syntactic convenience, when matching only a single pattern, the braces
around the catch block can be omitted.

[source]
.Example
----
try b = f.get; catch _ => b = False; <1>
----
<1> A “catch-all” exception handler that sets `b` to a default value in case an unhandled exception was propagated via `f`

NOTE: The `finally` block has the same restrictions as the class init and
recovery blocks, i.e., it cannot contain processor release points (i.e.,
`await` or `suspend`), blocking expressions (i.e., `get`), or explicitly throw
an exception via the `throw` statement.
