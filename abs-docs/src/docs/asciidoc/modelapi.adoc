== The Model API

The Erlang backend supports querying a running model.  When creating objects,
an annotation `HTTPName` makes them available via HTTP requests from outside
the model under the name given by the annotation.  Methods that are annotated
`HTTPCallable` can be invoked from the outside on such objects.  Additionally,
datatypes can be annotated to influence how they are converted to JSON when
they are returned from such methods.

The model API is supported by the Erlang backend.

NOTE: The Model API accepts connections only from local (loopback) addresses,
i.e., from the same machine.

NOTE: All queries in this section can be prepended with a `/v2/` prefix, i.e.,
`http://localhost:8080/v2/call` instead of `http://localhost:8080/call`.  In
case incompatible changes have to be introduced to the Model API in the
future, the semantics of invocations of queries with prefix `/v2/` will be
preserved.


=== Starting the Model API

When an ABS model compiled with the Erlang backend is started with the `-p`
parameter naming a port number, the model will listen on the specified port
for requests.  In the following example, we compile a model `my-model.abs` and
start the model API on port 8080:

----
$ absc --erlang my-model.abs
$ gen/erl/run -p 8080
----

=== Shutting down the Model API

When running a model with the model API activated, it will not return to the
command line after the simulation has finished.  Instead, the model will keep
listening for requests and method calls.

A running model can be terminated manually from the console (for example, via
pressing `Ctrl-C`), or by requesting the URL `/quit`.  The following command
will terminate a model running on port 8080:

----
$ curl localhost:8080/quit
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
----


=== Exposing objects

Objects are exposed via a `HTTPName` annotation.  In the following example,
two objects of class `C` are exposed with the names `C1` and `C2`
respectively.  The `HTTPName` annotation can be used on assignment statements,
variable declarations and `new` expression statements.

----
[HTTPName: "C1"] new C();
[HTTPName: "C2"] I x = new C();
----

=== Exposing methods

In an interface declaration, a `HTTPCallable` annotation exposes the annotated
method such that it is callable from outside, given an exposed object that implements that interface.

----
interface I {
  [HTTPCallable] String method(String param1, Int param2);
}
----

It is a compile-time error if the method takes parameters whose types are not
supported.

|===
| ABS type | URLencoded format | JSON format

| `Bool`
| literal upper- or lowercase `true` / `false`: `?p=True`, `?p=true`, `?p=False`, `?p=false`
| JSON boolean

| `Int`
| a string of digits, e.g., `?p=42`
| JSON integer

| `Float`
| a floating-point number, e.g., `?p=3.14`
| JSON float

| `String`
| URLEncoded text, e.g., `?p=Hello%20World!`
| JSON string

| `List<A>` (where `A` can be decoded)
| not supported
| JSON list with elements having type `A`

| not supported
| JSON map with all values having type `A`

| All others

|===

The method can have any return type.  Method call results will be returned as
a string via the ABS `toString()` function, except for the types enumerated in
the following table.

[caption="Encoding of return values", cols="33,67"]
|===
| ABS type | JSON format

| `Bool` | JSON boolean value

| `String` | JSON string value

| `Int` | JSON integer

| `Rat` | JSON float, via integer division.  The behavior is unspecified if
  the `Rat` value is outside of floating point range.

| `Float` | JSON float

| `List<A>` | JSON list, with elements converted one-by-one per this table.

| `Set<A>` | JSON list; guaranteed to contain no duplicate elements, with
  elements converted one-by-one per this table.

| `Map<A, B>` | JSON object, with keys generated from their ABS counterpart
  via `toString()`, values converted per this table.

| Datatype, with at least one named or annotated constructor argument | JSON
  object (see below)

| Others | Converted via ABS `toString()`
|===

User-defined datatypes are encoded depending on the presence of accessor
functions and `HTTPName` annotations.  If the datatype definition contains
neither, values will be encoded as strings via `toString()`.  If at least one
accessor function or `HTTPName` annotation is present, values will be encoded
as objects, with the `HTTPName` annotation value (or accessor function name,
if no annotation is present) as key.  Unnamed constructor argument values will
not be contained in the JSON object.

.Example of encoding of user-defined data types
|===
| ABS definition | Sample JSON encoding

| `data D1 = D1(String, Int);`
| `'D1("x", 1)'`, as per `toString()`

| `data D2 = D2(String key, Int);`
| `{ 'key': 'x' }`

| `data D3 = D3([HTTPName: "effective key"] String key, Int);`
| `{ 'effective key': 'x' }`

=== Querying object state

The following query returns the names of all exposed objects.

----
GET http://localhost:8080/o
----

Inspecting an object state directly can be useful for debugging.  The
following query returns a JSON map of the state of the object exposed as `C1`,
with object fields as keys.

----
GET http://localhost:8080/o/C1
----

The following query returns a JSON map containing the value of `C1`'s `field`,
with `"field"` as key.

----
GET http://localhost:8080/o/C1/field
----

When querying for an unknown object or an unknown field, the HTTP request will
produce a 404 response code.

NOTE: All queries in this section can be prepended with a `/v2/` prefix, i.e.,
`http://localhost:8080/v2/o`.  In case incompatible changes are introduced
to the Model API in the future, for example by introducing new return value
encodings, reasonable effort will be made to keep the semantics of invocations
of queries with prefix `/v2/` unchanged.



=== Querying exported methods of an object

The following query returns, for an object exposed as `C1`, a JSON array of
objects with metadata about callable functions.

----
GET http://localhost:8080/call/C1
----

Each entry in the resulting list will be a JSON object with the following
keys:

- `name`: the name of the exposed method
- `parameters`: an array with one object per parameter, each with the
  following entries:
  - `name`: name of the parameter
  - `type`: type of the parameter
- `return`: return type of the method


=== Invoking methods

Exposed methods are called by querying a URL of the form

----
http://.../call/<objectname>/<methodname>
----

Parameters are passed to methods either as query parameters in the URL or in a
JSON map passed in as the body of a POST request.  For duplicate arguments,
parameter values in the URL override values given in the JSON body.

The following query produces the return value of the method call
`method("value", 50)` by invoking it on the object exposed as `C1`.

----
GET http://localhost:8080/call/C1/method?param1=value&param2=50
----

This query can be invoked from the shell in two ways, using the `curl`
command, either using query parameters or a JSON body:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/call/C1/method?param1=value\&param2=50
$ curl -d "{ 'param1': 'value', 'param2': 50 }" http://localhost:8080/call/C1/method
----

The following example shows how to call a method that takes a `List<Int>` called `mylist` from Javascript using the JQuery library:

[source, javascript]
----
$.ajax({
    url: "call/Model/testConfig",
    type: "POST",
    data: JSON.stringify({ "mylist": [1,2,3] }),
}).done(function(result) {
    console.log("Result: " + JSON.stringify(result));
});
----

NOTE: Note the missing solidus (`/`) at the beginning of the query url -- this
makes the request robust against custom url prefixes (see
<<customizing-url-prefixes>>).

Care must be taken to disable timeouts on the HTTP client when querying for
long-running methods in this way.

When querying for unknown objects or methods, the HTTP request will produce a
404 response code.

When querying with invalid method parameters, the HTTP request will produce a
400 response code.

When the invoked method throws an exception, the HTTP request will produce a
500 response code.

=== The Model API and Timed ABS

The simulated clock of Timed ABS (<<sec:timed-abs>>) is accessible via
the Model API.

The current value of the clock can be obtained with the following request:

----
GET http://localhost:8080/clock/now
----

The result is a JSON object with a key `'result'` mapping to the
current value of the clock.

When the model was started with a clock limit (see
<<timed-abs-and-model-api>>), the limit can be increased via a request
like the following:

----
GET http://localhost:8080/clock/advance?by=50
----

The result is a JSON object with a key `'result'` mapping to the
new clock limit.

This call will always increase the clock limit by the given amount,
even if the clock had not yet reached the previous limit.  I.e., when
`now()` = 10 and the limit is 20, after the call the limit will be 70,
the same as when the clock was already stopped at the limit of 20 when
the call was received by the Model API.


=== Customizing the Browser-Based Visualization

Since the Model API is implemented via HTTP, it can be accessed from a
web browser.  The `--modelapi-index-file` command-line switch is used
to supply an `index.html` file at compile-time:

----
$ absc --erlang --modelapi-index-file ./index.html *.abs
----

When running a model on port 8080 and accessing
`http://localhost:8080/` from a browser, the contents of that file
will be displayed.

Sometimes it is necessary to add additional files for visualization,
e.g., CSS files, images or JavaScript libraries.  The contents of one
directory can be added to the model via the `--modelapi-static-dir`
command-line switch:

----
$ absc --erlang --modelapi-index-file ./index.html --modelapi-static-dir ./support-files/ *.abs
----

The contents of the given directory are copied at compile-time.  The
files within that directory are available within the Model API below
the `static/` path.  For example, a file `./support-files/js/d3.js`
will be accessible as `http://localhost:8080/static/js/d3.js`, and can be referred within the `index.html` file like this:

----
<script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/d3.js"></script>
----

[[customizing-url-prefixes]]
=== Customizing the Model API URL

It is sometimes necessary to change the url under which the model publishes
the given `index.html` file and static files.  When starting a model, the
parameter `--url-prefix` can be used to insert a prefix to these paths, and
to the `/call` and `/o` URLs described above.

As an example, the following command will make the index file given at compile-time available at http://localhost:8080/abcd/5080/index.html:

----
$ gen/erl/run -p 8080 --url-prefix /abcd/5080
----

CAUTION: In the `index.html` file, do not use an initial solidus (`/`) to
refer to static files and method calls, since such http requests will not work
when the model is run with an url prefix. Instead of `<script src="/static/js/d3.js"></script>`, write `<script src="static/js/d3.js"></script>`.
