== Timed ABS

Timed ABS is an extension to the core ABS language that introduces a notion of
_abstract time_.  Timed ABS can be used to model not only the functional
behavior but also the timing-related behavior of real systems running on real
hardware.  In contrast to real systems, time in an ABS model does not advance
by itself.  The time model of Timed ABS takes inspiration from formalisms such
as http://uppaal.org[Timed Automata] and
http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~peterol/RealTimeMaude/[Real-Time Maude].

NOTE: All untimed ABS models are valid in Timed ABS.  An ABS model that
contains no time-influencing statements will run without influencing the clock
and will finish at time zero.

The ABS notion of time is _dense time_ with _run-to-completion semantics_.
Timed ABS adds a clock to the language semantics that advances in response to
certain language constructs.  Time is expressed as a rational number, so the
clock can advance in infinitesimally small steps.

It is possible to assign _deadlines_ to method calls.  Deadlines are expressed
in terms of a duration value relative to the current time and decrease as the
clock advances.  The current deadline of a method is available via the
function `deadline` and decreases down to zero.

Time only advances when all processes are blocked or suspended and no process
is ready to run.  This means that for time to advance, all processes are in
one of the following states:

* the process is awaiting for a guard that is not enabled (see <<await-stmt>>)
* the process is blocked on a future that is not available (see
  <<get-expression>>)
* the process is suspended waiting for time to advance
* the process is waiting for some resources

In practice this means that all processes run as long as there is “work to be
done.”



=== Datatypes and Constructors

Time is expressed as a datatype `Time`, durations are expressed using the
datatype `Duration`, which can be infinite.  These datatypes are defined in
the standard library as follows:

[source]
----
data Time = Time(Rat timeValue);
data Duration = Duration(Rat durationValue) | InfDuration;
----

=== Functions

.now

The function `now` always returns the current time.

[source]
----
def Time now()
----

Note that since ABS uses simulated time, two calls to `now` can return the same
value.  Specifically, the result of `now()` changes only by executing
`duration` or `await duration` statements, or by waiting for resources to
become available.

[source]
----
  Time t1 = now();
  Int i = pow(2, 50);
  Time t2 = now();
  assert (t1 == t2); <1>
----
<1> This assertion will not fail, since no time has passed in the model.  Time
advance in ABS is explicit and can only occur in suspension points.

.deadline

The function `deadline` returns the deadline of the current process.

[source]
----
def Duration deadline()
----

The initial value of a deadline is set via a `Deadline` annotation at the
caller site.

[source]
----
Unit m() {
  [Deadline: Duration(10)] this!n(); <1>
}

Unit n() {
  Duration d1 = deadline(); <2>
  await duration(2, 2);
  Duration d2 = deadline(); <3>
}
----
<1> The `Deadline` annotation assigns a deadline to the process started by the asynchronous method call
<2> The process can query its current deadline; if no deadline is given, `deadline` returns `InfDuration`
<3> `d2` will be two time units less than `d1`

.timeValue

The function `timeValue` returns the value of its argument as a rational number.

[source]
----
def Rat timeValue(Time t);
----

.timeDifference

The function `timeDifference` returns the absolute value of the difference
between its two arguments, i.e., a value greater or equal to `0`.

[source]
----
def Rat timeDifference(Time t1, Time t2);
----

.timeLessThan

The function `timeLessThan` returns `True` if the value of its first argument
is less than the value of its second argument.

[source]
----
def Bool timeLessThan(Time t1, Time t2);
----


.durationValue

The function `durationValue` returns the value of its argument as a rational number.

[source]
----
def Rat durationValue(Time t);
----

.isDurationInfinite

The function `isDurationInfinite` returns `True` if its argument is `InfDuration`, `False` if its argument is `Duration(x)` for some value `x`.

[source]
----
def Bool isDurationInfinite(Duration d);
----

.addDuration

The function `addDuration` adds a duration to a time, returning a new value of
type `Time`.  It is an error to pass `InfDuration` as an argument to this
function.

[source]
----
def Time addDuration(Time t, Duration d);
----

.subtractDuration

The function `subtractDuration` subtracts a duration from a time, returning a
new value of type `Time`.  It is an error to pass `InfDuration` as an argument
to this function.

[source]
----
def Time subtractDuration(Time t, Duration d);
----

.durationLessThan

The function `durationLessThan` returns `True` if the value of its first
argument is less than the value of its second argument.  In case both
arguments are `InfDuration`, `durationLessThan` returns `False`.

[source]
----
def Bool durationLessThan(Duration d1, Duration d2);
----

.subtractFromDuration

The function `subtractFromDuration` subtracts a value `v` from a duration,
returning a new value of type `Duration`.  In case its first argument is
`InfDuration`, the result will also be `InfDuration`.

[source]
----
def Duration subtractFromDuration(Duration d, Rat v);
----


=== Statements

The `duration(min, max)` statement blocks the cog of the executing process
until at least `min` and at most `max` time units have passed.  The `await
duration(min, max)` statement (see <<await-stmt>>) suspends the current
process until at least `min` and at most `max` time units have passed.

.Syntax
|====
| _DurationStmt_ ::= | `duration` `(` _PureExp_ `,` _PureExp_ `)` `;`
| _AwaitStmt_ ::= | `await` _Guard_ `;`
| _Guard_ ::= | ... {vbar} _DurationGuard_
| _DurationGuard_ ::= | `duration` `(` _PureExp_ `,` _PureExp_ `)`
|====


The difference between `duration` and `await duration` is that in the latter
case other processes in the same cog can execute while the awaiting process is
suspended.  In the case of the blocking `duration` statement, no other process
in the same cog can execute.  Note that processes in other cogs are not
influenced by `duration` or `await duration`, except when they attempt to
synchronize with that process.

NOTE: A subtle difference between `duration` and `await duration` is that in
the latter case, the suspended process becomes eligible for scheduling after
the specified time, but there is no guarantee that it will actually be
scheduled at that point.  This means that more time might pass than expressed in the `await duration` guard!

.Examples

----
  Time t = now();
  await duration(1/2, 5); <1>
  Time t2 = now(); <2>
----
<1> Here the *process* suspends for 1/2-5 time units
<2> `t2` will be at least 1/2 time units larger than `t`

----
  Time t = now();
  duration(1/2, 5); <1>
  Time t2 = now(); <2>
----
<1> Here the *cog* blocks for 1/2-5 time units
<2> `t2` will be between 1/2 and 5 time units larger than `t`

=== Semantics of Time Advancement

The simulated clock advances such that it makes the least amount of “jumps”
without missing any point of interest.  This means that when a process waits
or blocks for an interval _(min, max)_, the clock will not advance more than
_max_, since otherwise it would miss unblocking the process.  On the other
hand, the clock will advance by the highest amount allowed by the model.  This
means that if only one process waits for _(min, max)_, the clock will advance
by _max_.

[[fig-time-advance]]
image::ABS-time-advance.png[width=510,height=150,title="Big-step time advance",alt="Big-step time advance"]

Figure <<fig-time-advance>> shows a timeline with two process, `P1` and `P2`.
They are waiting for time to advance between `(4, 6)` and `(3, 5)` units,
respectively.  Assuming that no other process is ready to run, the clock will
advance the maximum amount that still hits the earliest interval, in this
case 5.  Since the clock is now within both intervals, both processes are
unblocked and ready to run.

[[timed-abs-and-model-api]]
=== Timed ABS and the Model API

By default, the clock will advance when all processes within the model
are waiting for the clock.  However, it is sometimes desirable to
synchronize the internal clock with some external event or system, and
therefore to temporarily block it from advancing beyond a certain
value.

When starting a model, the erlang backend (<<sec:erlang-backend>>) supports
a parameter `-l x` or `--clock-limit x` which stops the clock at the
given value `x`.  This makes it possible to model infinite systems up
to a certain clock value.  When the clock limit is reached, the model
will terminate even if there are processes which would be enabled by
further clock advancement.

When starting a model with both the `-l` and `-p` parameters (i.e.,
with both the model api and a clock limit), a request to the model api
of the form `/clock/advance?by=x` will increase the clock limit by
`x`, thereby causing waiting processes to run until the new limit is
reached.
